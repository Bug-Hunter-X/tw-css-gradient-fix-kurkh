```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```
This code might not render correctly if the `tailwind.config.js` file doesn't have the necessary configuration for gradient colors.  It's also possible the `from-blue-500` and `to-purple-500` color values aren't defined in your theme.
